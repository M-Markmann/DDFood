# A tool to analyze behavioral data in a temporal discounting study, with primary and secondary rewards

This tool is designed to
1. Convert log files from our conducted experiments into an easily machine-readable array format
2. For both conditions in the experiment (Primary and Secondary reward):
    1. For all five models  estimate the best fitting model parameters using both loglikelihood estimation and non-linear least squares
    2. calculate ΔAIC and R<sup>2</sup> for all five temporal discounting equations discussed in Peters & Büchel 2012
Hyperbol without scaling, Exponential without scaling, Hyperbol with scaling of the delay, Hyperbol with scaling of the denominator, Exponential with scaling
3. 


|   | Hyperbol   | Exponential|
|---|---|---|
| Without scaling| $SV={Amount \over 1+k*D} $  |   |
| With scaling |$SV={Amount \over 1+k*D} $   |   |   |   |
